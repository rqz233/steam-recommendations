# CIS 520 PROJECT
## About
Steam is a desktop application with which users buy and play computer games.  We employ neighborhood, matrix factorization, and mixed collaborative filtering (CF) methods to predict the number of hours users will play games. In addition, we adapt a regression boosting frame-work for matrix factorization CF algorithms and apply it to the prediction task. We find that factorization methods outperform neighborhood methods, and a mixed approach outperforms both. Additionally, we find the boosting framework did not meaningful improve performance. To improve predictions, future research should incorporate user friendship networks.
